# ✨ Tic-Tac-Toe with Artificial Intelligence (Brain.js)

🎮 Interactive browser game where you play against a neural network!

## 🚀 Description
This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a trainable AI using brain.js. After each move, the neural network analyzes the board, shows the most probable move with a 🤖 icon, and makes its move with a short delay for clarity.

## 🔍 Code Overview
- `index.html` — game board layout, status, neural network visualization, AI move probability display.
- `style.css` — styling for the board and elements.
- `script.js` — game logic, neural network training and operation, move handling, visualization.
  - After the player's move:
    - The AI's probable move is displayed: <span style="font-size:1.2em;">🤖</span>
    - After 1 second, the AI makes its move.
  - All cells are numbered for the user from 1 to 9.

## 🛠️ Features
- Play against artificial intelligence
- Neural network structure visualization
- Display of AI move probability with 🤖 icon
- Delay before AI move for clarity
- Neural network training on simulated games

## 📦 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Make a move — the AI will train and start playing against you.

## 👨‍💻 For Beginners
- Code is well-commented
- Cell numbering for users — from 1 to 9
- All changes are visible instantly in the browser
